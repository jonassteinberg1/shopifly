# PRD: Shopify Merchant Interview Research Program

## Overview

**Objective:** Conduct qualitative market research through direct interviews with Shopify merchants to validate scraped pain points, discover new insights, and understand willingness to pay for solutions.

**Scope:** Recruitment, interview process, data collection, and integration with existing pain point pipeline.

**Target Participants:** Small-revenue Shopify merchants ($1K-$50K monthly GMV) - the primary target customer segment for our apps.

---

## Why Direct Interviews?

| Data Source | Strengths | Limitations |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Web Scraping (Reddit, Forums) | Scale, unfiltered complaints | Selection bias (only vocal users), no follow-up questions |
| App Store Reviews | Specific to apps, ratings | Often shallow, focused on existing solutions |
| **Direct Interviews** | Depth, context, WTP validation | Time-intensive, smaller sample size |

**Interviews complement scraping by:**
- Validating whether scraped pain points are real priorities (vs. just rants)
- Understanding the full context around problems
- Gauging actual willingness to pay (not just frustration)
- Discovering pain points merchants don't publicly discuss
- Building relationships with potential beta testers

---

## Research Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Validate top pain points** identified through web scraping pipeline
2. **Quantify willingness to pay** for solutions (price sensitivity, budget ranges)
3. **Understand current workarounds** and their limitations
4. **Identify app fatigue** - are merchants overwhelmed by too many apps?

### Secondary Goals
1. Discover pain points not captured in public forums
2. Understand merchant personas and decision-making process
3. Identify potential beta testers for future products
4. Build an email list for product launch announcements

---

## Target Participant Profile

### Ideal Participant Criteria

| Criteria | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Monthly GMV | $1,000 - $50,000 | Small merchants are our target; large stores have different needs |
| Store Age | 6+ months | Enough experience to have real pain points |
| Industry | Any (diverse mix) | Avoid bias toward one vertical |
| App Usage | Uses 3+ apps | Familiar with app ecosystem |
| Location | US only | Easier timezone coordination, largest market |

### Exclusion Criteria
- Dropshipping-only stores (different pain points)
- Agency-managed stores (not the decision maker)
- Stores using Shopify Plus (enterprise tier)
- Competitors or app developers

### Target Sample Size
- **Phase 1:** 15-20 interviews (initial validation)
- **Phase 2:** 30-40 interviews (deeper analysis by segment)
- **Ongoing:** 5-10 interviews/month (continuous discovery)

### Interview Script

```
WARM-UP (3 min)
---
"Thanks for taking the time to chat! Before we dive in, I'd love to hear
a quick intro about you and your store."

- What's your store name and what do you sell?
- How long have you been running it?
- Is this your full-time business or a side project?

- What does your tech stack look like? (Apps, tools you use)
- What's working really well for you right now?


PAIN POINT EXPLORATION (10 min)
---
"Now I'd love to hear about challenges."

[Open-ended first - don't lead]
- If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing about running your
  Shopify store, what would it be? Why?
- Tell me about a time in the last month when you felt frustrated
  with your store. What happened?
- What takes up more of your time than it should?

[Probe on top scraped pain points - pick 2-3 relevant to their business]
- "Other merchants have mentioned [X] as a challenge. Is that something
  you've experienced?"
- If yes: "Tell me more about that. How does it affect your business?"
- If no: "What do you do differently that avoids this problem?"

[Probe depth on #1 pain]
- How long have you been dealing with this issue?
- What have you tried to solve it?
- How much time/money do you estimate this costs you?


SOLUTIONS & WTP (5 min)

"Let's talk about potential solutions."

- [If yes] What did you find? Why didn't you use them / why did you stop?
- [If no] What would an ideal solution look like?
- If a tool existed that solved [top pain], what would you be willing
  to pay per month?
  [If they struggle: "Would $10/month be reasonable? $30? $50?"]
- What's your total monthly spend on Shopify apps right now?
- Do you feel like you have too many apps?


WRAP-UP (2 min)
---
"This has been really helpful. A few final things:"

- Is there anything I didn't ask about that you think I should know?
- Would you be open to trying a beta version of a tool if we build
  something to address [their pain]?
- Can I follow up via email if I have any clarifying questions?

"I'll send your $50 gift card within 24 hours. Thanks again!"
```

### Recording & Note-Taking

**Recording (Optional):**
- Ask permission but make it optional: "Would you mind if I record this for my notes?
  It's totally optional and won't be shared publicly."
- If declined, rely on detailed live notes
- Use Zoom/Google Meet built-in recording when permitted
- Store recordings securely (Google Drive with restricted access)
- Delete after transcription (30 days max)

**Live Notes:**
- Use a structured template (see Data Collection section)
- Capture verbatim quotes for key insights
- Note emotional intensity (frustrated, resigned, excited)
- Mark timestamps for key moments

```

### Post-Interview Workflow

```
1. Within 24 hours of interview:
   [ ] Send gift card via email
   [ ] Upload recording to secure storage
   [ ] Complete structured data entry
   [ ] Add verbatim quotes to quotes database

2. Within 48 hours:
   [ ] Transcribe key sections (or full if valuable)
   [ ] Tag insights with categories
   [ ] Flag for follow-up if needed

3. Weekly:
   [ ] Review new insights against scraped data
   [ ] Update priority rankings
   [ ] Identify emerging patterns
```

## Analysis & Synthesis

### Cross-Referencing with Scraped Data

```python
def correlate_interview_with_scraped(interview_insights: list, scraped_insights: list):
    """
    Compare interview findings with web-scraped pain points.

    Output:
    - Validated pain points (appear in both sources)
    - Interview-only pain points (discovered through interviews)
    - Scraped-only pain points (may be overrepresented online)
    """

    correlation_report = {
        "validated": [],      # High confidence - appears in both
        "interview_only": [], # Potential hidden gems
        "scraped_only": [],   # May be vocal minority
        "wtp_validated": [],  # Pain points with confirmed WTP
    }

    return correlation_report
```

### Priority Scoring (Interview-Enhanced)

```python
def calculate_interview_enhanced_priority(pain_point: dict) -> float:
    """
    Enhanced priority score incorporating interview data.

    Base score (from scraping):
    - relevance × 0.20
    - frustration × 0.15
    - engagement × 0.15
    - wtp_signal × 0.10
    - recency × 0.05

    Interview bonus (up to 0.35):
    - interview_validated × 0.15  # Confirmed in interviews
    - interview_wtp × 0.10        # Explicit WTP mentioned
    - business_impact × 0.10      # High impact described

    Total: 1.0
    """

    base_score = calculate_base_priority(pain_point)  # Existing function

    interview_bonus = 0
    if pain_point.get("interview_validated"):
        interview_bonus += 0.15
    if pain_point.get("interview_wtp_confirmed"):
        interview_bonus += 0.10
    if pain_point.get("business_impact") == "high":
        interview_bonus += 0.10

    return (base_score * 0.65) + interview_bonus
```

## Decisions Made

1. **Incentive amount:** $50 Amazon gift card per interview
2. **Recording consent:** Optional (ask but don't require)
3. **Geographic targeting:** US-only initially for timezone convenience

## Open Questions

1. **Anonymization:** How strictly do we need to anonymize data? Hash emails only, or full anonymization?

2. **Beta tester commitment:** Should we ask for explicit commitment (e.g., sign up form) or just note interest?

Thanks for taking the time to chat today about your Shopify store.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.800
So tell me, what's the biggest challenge you face running your Shopify store?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:28.400
Honestly, inventory management is killing me. I have products on Amazon and Etsy too, and keeping stock levels synced is a nightmare. I spend like two hours a day just updating inventory manually.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.500
That sounds really frustrating. What have you tried so far to solve this?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:52.300
I tried Stocky but it doesn't work with my other channels. I've also looked at Skubana but it's way too expensive for my size store. They wanted like five hundred dollars a month which is insane.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.200
If there was a solution that worked perfectly for multi-channel inventory, what would you be willing to pay for it monthly?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.500
I'd easily pay thirty to fifty dollars a month for something that just works. Even up to seventy-five if it was really good and saved me those two hours daily.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.300
That makes sense. Are there any other pain points with your store operations?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:45.800
Yeah, analytics is another big one. I can't track customer lifetime value at all. I have no idea which customers are actually profitable versus which ones are just buying once with a coupon and never coming back.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:02.100
I've tried a few analytics apps like Lifetimely and OrderMetrics but they're either too complicated or don't give me the simple answers I need. I just want to know who my best customers are.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.500
Would you pay for better LTV tracking and customer analytics?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.600
Definitely. I'd pay maybe twenty to thirty dollars a month for good customer analytics. It would help me make better decisions about where to spend my marketing budget.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.400
Great insights. One last question - how big is your team and how many apps do you currently use?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.200
It's just me and one part-time helper. We use about eight apps right now and I'm paying around two hundred dollars a month total for them. It adds up fast.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Thanks so much for your time. This has been really helpful.
